Description: Identify and visualize individuals with unusual association patterns of genetics and geography. It detects potential outliers that violate the isolation-by-distance assumption using the K-nearest neighbor approach. You can obtain a table of outliers with statistics and visualize unusual geo-genetic patterns on a geographical map. This is useful for landscape genomics studies to discover individuals with unusual geography and genetics associations from a large biological sample.
