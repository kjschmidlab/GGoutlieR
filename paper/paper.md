# Summary

# Statement of need

Landscape genomics is a thriving field in ecological conservation (CITATION) and evolutionary genetics (CITATION).
It provides insights of associations between genetic variation and environmental factors.
This methodology requires reliable geographical and genomic information of biological samples.
The pairwise genetic similarity of biological samples is expected to decline as geographical distance between origin habitats increasing, so called isolation-by-distance.
This assumption could be violated due to long-distance migration or artificial factors, such as human transportation or mistakes in data management.
Researchers may wish to scrutinize samples against the isolation-by-distance assumptions and decide what action should be done for those samples.
Several visualization-based tools can help researchers to investigate the association between genetic similarities and geographical origins, like plot of principal component analysis, SPA [@yang2012model], SpaceMix [@bradburd2016spatial], unPC [@house2018evaluating].
